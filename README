BiRelCost : Bidirectional Type Analysis for Relational Costs
------------------------------------------------------------- 

This repository implements a bidirectional type checker for a
refinement type and effect system.

See INSTALL for directions for compiling and running BiRelCost and its test framework.

See NOTES for detailed notes on notation, troubleshooting and misc.

This software uses why3 0.87.3 and alt-ergo 1.30.

What is where?
-----------------------------
- all the OCaml source is in src/
  * birel.ml [Main file]
  * tycheck.ml [Core typechecking functor]
  * binary.ml  [Binary typechecking engine]
  * unary.ml   [Unary typechecking engine]
  * test.ml    [Test framework]
- example programs are in examples/

- why theory file, containing all the necessary lemmas for Why3, is
  'birel.why'
